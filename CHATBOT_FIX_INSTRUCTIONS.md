# Chatbot Fix Instructions

## The Problem

Your chatbot was not receiving or displaying reply messages because of an architectural issue with the webhook flow. The original code was trying to:

1. Send message to Make.com webhook
2. **Wait for immediate response in the same HTTP request**

But webhook flows work differently - Make.com needs to send the response back via a **separate request**.

## The Solution

I've implemented a proper webhook system with the following components:

### 1. Updated ChatWidget (`src/components/chatbot/ChatWidget.tsx`)
- Now generates unique session IDs for each message
- Registers a callback function for when the response comes back
- Sends message to Make.com without expecting immediate response
- Includes timeout handling (30 seconds)

### 2. Webhook Manager (`src/lib/webhook.ts`)
- Manages chat sessions and pending responses
- Handles incoming webhook responses from Make.com
- Provides cleanup and timeout functionality

### 3. Webhook Receiver (`src/components/chatbot/WebhookReceiver.tsx`)
- Creates a global `window.receiveChatResponse` function
- Make.com can call this function to send responses back

### 4. Updated App Component (`src/App.tsx`)
- Added WebhookReceiver component to enable webhook handling

## Make.com Configuration Required

You need to update your Make.com scenario to send the ChatGPT response back to your website. Here are two methods:

### Method 1: JavaScript Execution (Recommended)
After getting the ChatGPT response, add a **JavaScript** module in Make.com with this code:

```javascript
if (window.receiveChatResponse) {
    // Parse the message from the ChatGPT response
    let messageText = "";
    try {
        // If the response is a JSON string with a message field
        const parsed = JSON.parse("{{chatgpt_response}}");
        messageText = parsed.message || "{{chatgpt_response}}";
    } catch (e) {
        // If it's not JSON, use the response directly
        messageText = "{{chatgpt_response}}";
    }
    
    window.receiveChatResponse({
        sessionId: "{{1.sessionId}}", // Use the sessionId from the incoming webhook
        response: messageText,
        timestamp: "{{now}}" // Current timestamp
    });
} else {
    console.error('receiveChatResponse function not found');
}
```

### Method 2: HTTP POST (Alternative)
Add an **HTTP** module that sends a POST request to your website with:
- URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook-response`
- Method: POST
- Body: 
```json
{
    "sessionId": "{{1.sessionId}}",
    "response": "{{chatgpt_response}}",
    "timestamp": "{{now}}"
}
```

## Current Message Flow

### Before (Broken):
1. User sends message → Website
2. Website sends to Make.com → **Waits for response**
3. Make.com → ChatGPT → **Response expected immediately**
4. ❌ **This doesn't work because Make.com can't return the response immediately**

### After (Fixed):
1. User sends message → Website
2. Website sends to Make.com (with sessionId) → **No waiting**
3. Make.com → ChatGPT → Gets response
4. Make.com calls `window.receiveChatResponse()` → Website displays response
5. ✅ **This works because it's asynchronous**

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the updated code** to your website
2. **Update your Make.com scenario** with the JavaScript module above
3. **Test the chatbot** - messages should now receive responses
4. **Check browser console** for any errors or debugging info

## Debugging

If it's still not working:

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Verify Make.com is receiving** the webhook with sessionId
3. **Confirm Make.com is executing** the JavaScript response code
4. **Test with the webhook example** at `/webhook-example.html`

## Key Changes Made

- ✅ Proper asynchronous webhook handling
- ✅ Session management for matching requests/responses  
- ✅ Timeout handling for failed responses
- ✅ Global function for Make.com to call
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Test page for debugging webhook responses

The chatbot should now properly receive and display responses from ChatGPT via Make.com!
